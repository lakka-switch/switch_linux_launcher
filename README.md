# Switch Linux Launcher for Android
This is a simple Android port of the fail0verflow's ShofEL2 exploit.

My fork doesn't contain `imx_usb` as it's not necessary anymore. I changed the application ID to prevent conflicts.

### Credits
- fail0verflow - the ShofEL2 exploit, all the reverse engineering efforts
- Retr0id / DavidBuchanan314 - for writing the Android Fusée Gelée launcher, minor help in development of this app
- others in the Switch hacking scene - for being awesome!
